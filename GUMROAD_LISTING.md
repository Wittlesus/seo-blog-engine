## Full Description

### The Problem

You know you need to publish blog content for SEO. But every time you sit down to write, you spend the first 45 minutes just on structure:

- What H2 sections should I include?
- Did I add a meta description?
- What about FAQ schema markup for rich results?
- Where should I place my target keywords?
- Do I have a table of contents?
- What about internal linking?
- Is my content the right length to compete?

That is 45 minutes of setup -- before you write a single word of actual content.

### The Solution

**SEO Blog Engine** generates a complete, SEO-optimized blog post structure in under 3 seconds.

You provide a topic and keywords. The engine outputs a production-ready markdown file with:

- YAML frontmatter (title, description, date, tags, slug, canonical URL)
- SEO-optimized title with current year
- Meta description at the ideal 150-160 character length
- Table of contents with anchor links
- 5-8 H2 sections with relevant H3 subsections
- Introduction template with hook, context, and promise structure
- Image placeholders with ALT text reminders for accessibility and SEO
- Internal and external link placeholders
- Keyword density targets and placement guides
- FAQ section with ready-to-paste JSON-LD schema markup
- Call to action section
- A complete SEO checklist you can review before publishing

All you have to do is fill in the content. The structure, SEO elements, and best practices are already done.

- **Freelance writers** who want consistent, high-quality structure for every client
- **Developer advocates** creating technical content at scale
- **SEO agencies** managing content for multiple clients
- **Solo bloggers** who want to compete with professional content teams

### What You Get

- The complete `seo-blog-engine` CLI tool (Node.js)
- 4 content templates (How-To, Listicle, Comparison, Ultimate Guide)
- Example topics file for batch generation
- Full source code -- customize templates to match your brand
- Lifetime updates -- new templates and features added over time

### How It Works

```
# Install
npm install -g seo-blog-engine

# Generate a blog post
seo-blog generate --topic "How to Deploy to AWS" --keywords "AWS, deployment, Node.js"

# Generate 10 posts at once
seo-blog batch --topics topics.json --output ./blog/

# Preview an outline
seo-blog outline --topic "React vs Vue"
```

That is it. 3 seconds from topic to fully structured blog post.

### The Math

If you publish 4 blog posts per month and save 45 minutes per post, that is 3 hours saved per month. At a content writer rate of $50/hour, this tool pays for itself in the first 2 weeks.

And it keeps saving you time every single month after that.
